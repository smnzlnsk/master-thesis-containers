# Benchmarking Containers

This repository contains containerized benchmarking applications for system performance testing:

## Directory Structure

- **[fps/](fps/)**: FPS (Frames Per Second) benchmarking application
  - Simulates FPS metrics using a sine wave pattern 
  - Exports metrics via OpenTelemetry

- **[cpu-ram/](cpu-ram/)**: CPU and RAM benchmarking application
  - Provides CPU load testing capabilities
  - Provides memory allocation testing

## Getting Started

Please refer to the README.md files in each directory for specific instructions on how to build and run each benchmarking application:

- [FPS Benchmarking](fps/README.md)
- [CPU-RAM Benchmarking](cpu-ram/README.md)
